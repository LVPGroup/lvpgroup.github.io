BlockState defines the bit info in bitmap. We uses different types, while not 0 or 1 in this design.
Then the blockstate could be implemented as 0 or 1, with additional information. 

basic states of memory block are ALLOCATED, FREE, DIVIDED and NOEXIST.
The levels of bitmap is actually a quad-tree of BlockState. 
ALLOCATED: the block is allocated to a thread
FREE: the block is free
DIVIDED: the block is divided, which means is was splited to 4 subblocks
NOEXIST: the block is not exist 

ALLOCACTED and FREE blocks are the leaf blocks of the quad-tree. 
DIVIDED blocks are inner nodes of the quad-tree.
Otherwise is NOEXIST.

we also introduce FREEING and ALLOCATING state to avoid a case that a FREEING block may be allocated by other threads
and a ALLOCATING block may be freed by other threads. In OS implementation, the allocating/freeing block is 
an inner block of alloc/free services, and other threads will not manipulate them.  
they are used to indicate state of the block which are going to be merged during freeing a block,
and the block which is going to be split during allocating a block. 

we may remove FREEING/ALLOCATING state later by revising alloc and free syscalls to avoid allocate or free blocks 
in freeing\_node and allocating\_node.

a memory pool is actually a forest of @n\_max numbers of blocks with size of @max\_sz. 
A block may be split to 4 sub-blocks and so on, at most for @n\_levels times. Thus, each block may be split as a quad-tree.
a memory pool maintains a big memory block, where @buf is the start address of the memory block.
The size of a memory pool is @n\_max * @max\_sz. 
@max\_sz has a constraint. a small block at last level (level index is @n\_levels - 1) should be aligned by 4 bits,
i.e. the size of block at last level should be 4*n (n &gt; 0). Here, we dont demand $4^n$, which is a special case of 4*n. 
Thus, @max\_sz should be $4*n*4^n\_levels$. 

@levels maintain the information at each level including a bitmap and a free block list.
@wait\_q is a list of threads, which is blocked on this memory pool.

The state of memory management consists of thread state, memory pools, and local variables of each thread.
In monocore OSs, there is only one currently executing thread @cur, where None means the scheduler has not choose a thread.
@tick save a time for the system.
@mem\_pools maintains the refs of all memory pools.
@mem\_pool\_info shows the detailed information of each memory pool by its ref.
we assume that all memory pools are shared by all threads. This is the most relaxed case. 
The case that some memory pool is only shared by a set of thread is just a special case. 
Other fields are local vars of each thread used in alloc/free syscalls.

for each thread, we use freeing\_node to maintain the freeing node in free syscall. 
when free a block, we set it to FREEING, and check if its other 3 partner blocks are also free. 
If so, we set the 4 blocks to NOEXIST and set their parent block to FREEING, and so on. 
until that other 3 partner blocks are not all free, then set the FREEING block to FREE. 
This design avoids the FREEING node is allocated by other threads.

we use allocating\_node to maintain the allocating node in alloc syscall. 
when alloc a block, we find a free block at the nearest upper level, and set it to ALLOCATING.
if size of the block is too big, we split it into 4 child blocks. 
We set the first child block to ALLOCATING and other 3 blocks to FREE, and so on. 
until that the size of block is suitable, then set the ALLOCATING block to ALLOCATED.
This design avoids the ALLOCATING node is freed by other threads.

Since Zephyr uses fine-grained locks for shared memory pools, 
interleaving among scheduling, syscalls (alloc, free), and clock tick are allowed. 
Thus, we use 3 event systems to model scheduling, syscalls from threads, and clock tick. 
Then the whole system is the parallel composition of the three event systems. 
Actually, we have 1 scheduler, 1 timer, and n threads.

return CODE for alloc and free syscalls.
free syscall always succeed, so it returns OK. 
alloc syscall may succeed (OK), timeout (ETIMEOUT), fails(ENOMEM), fails due to request too large size (ESIZEERR).

EAGAIN is an inner flag of alloc syscall. After it finds an available block for request, the block may be allocated immediately
by other threads. In such a case, alloc will provide EAGAIN and try to allocate again. 

We introduce ESIZEERR for Zephyr to avoid a dead loop. 
We introduce ETIMEOUT for Zephyr for robustness.

due to fine-grained lock used by Zephyr, we use a command for each atomic statement in free/alloc syscalls.
the statements of syscalls from a thread $t$ can only be executed when $t$ is the currently executing thread by the scheduler.
We use the AWAIT statement to represent this semantics.
