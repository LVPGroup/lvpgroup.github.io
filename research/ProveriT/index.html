<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div class="abstract">
The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) plays a crucial role in modern computer systems and the compromise of TEE
can result in enormous losses. Although numerous TEE products have been proposed, most of them lack robust security guarantees.
To address this concern, GlobalPlatform (GP) defines the TEE security standard, Protection Profile (PP), which has gained widespread
adoption in the TEE development and Common Criteria (CC) evaluation. However, despite its importance, GPTEE PP has never been
formally specified and verified. In this paper, we present ProveriT , a parameterized, composable, and formally verified model of GPTEE
PP. Firstly, we propose the first formal specification of GPTEE PP in a parameterized manner, encompassing the definition of security
problems, security objectives, and security functional requirements. Secondly, we provide a compositional framework, utilizing horizontal
calculus and vertical calculus, to flexibly combine specific security functional requirements for TEE developers and reduce proof efforts
for verification. ProveriT is extensible and reusable for the verification and CC evaluation of specific TEE products. Thirdly, we conduct
a comprehensive formal verification of rationales in the model to ensure the correctness of GPTEE PP. During the verification, 8 issues
are discovered and we provide suggestions to resolve them. Finally, we demonstrate the extensibility and effectiveness of ProveriT by
applying it to the verification of a commercial TEE. All the specifications and verification are carried out in the Isabelle/HOL theorem
prover.

<h2>Code Repository Introduction</h2>
<div class="abstract">
The code repository is composed of ProveriT, i.e., the formal model of GPTEE PP, and a real-world case study of MiTEE. ProveriT comprises 9 files including the formalization of Security Problem Definitions, Security Objectives, and Security Functional Requirements. MiTEE case study comprises 3 files for its security model and instantiation. The source code is commented with detailed descriptions of the GPTEE PP for readability and the whole formal model is checkable.
